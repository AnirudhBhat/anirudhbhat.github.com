1. **Insured Declared Value (IDV)**: IDV is the maximum amout that is given to the policyholder by the insurance company in case of theft or total loss of the vehicle. IDV is calculated as manufacturer's listed selling price - Depriciation. Always try to go for maximum IDV.


2. **Zero-Depreciation-Cover:** Every year the value of your vehicle keeps declining. This declining of amount is called Depriciation. Taking Zero-Depreciation-Cover means that any damage that happens to your car, the insurance company will bear all the expense and you won't have to give any money. This solves a lot of headache when the time comes. 

	Without Zero-Depreciation-Cover, the insurance company will only cover some major amount of the damage and you have to cover the rest from your own pocket. This is headache to know what parts you need to cover and on what situation since these details will not be clear in the insurance

3. **Engine protection add on**. Since Engine is the main part in any vehicle. It's always a safe bet to put some money on the Engine. Any damage to the engine and the insurance company has the liability to cover that for you.


4. **No claim bonus:** Try to get the no claim bonus addon so that each year that you do not claim for the insurance, you get some discount on your premium. Although, I think the discount applies for the premium only up to 50% it's still a good bargain.


5. **Cashless garage tie-ups:** Check which insurance has the most number of cashless garage tie-ups so that when the time comes, you don't have to learn which garages are supported by your insurance companies for seamless experience.
