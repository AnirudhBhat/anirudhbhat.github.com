1. Everyone has a smartphone and the impact is more.
2. Users get to see, play, and enjoy our craft.
3. Short feedback cycle for developers. You get to see the results of your work in short time.
4. Unlike web development, mobile development comes with many constraints.
   - What if there is no internet?
   - Battery constraint
   - Apps fighting each other for the system resource and OS can kill our app anytime
   - App lifecycle. User can put our app in background and come back at it several days later
   - Portrait and Landscape mode
   - Accessibility
   - Offline first and many more!
5. Our app feels a lot closer since we can carry around with us like a baby!
6. Being able to access things like location, Bluetooth, NFC, contacts and schedule makes the user experience more personalised.
