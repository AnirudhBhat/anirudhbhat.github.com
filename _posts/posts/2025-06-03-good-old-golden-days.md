When I was ten, I spent the whole summer every year having fun, playing sports, climbing trees with my cousins. Yet, I was compaining very often - "I want to grow up fast. I'm tired of being a small kid".

Every one of my cousins told me the same. "Believe me you don't want to. You are living your golden days"

I did not believed them.

Years later, I married love of my life. We had some good times and some bad times. We watched movies, hiked, visited places, every night walk after dinner, we fought. It was a beautiful time.

then came 2021, my son was born. Most of our times was spent on taking care of the little one. We got less or no time for us.

One afternoon, I was holding my son in my both hands, swinging my arms slowly to soothe him through the pain of vaccination. I was gently walking and I longed for the days when my wife and I could simply be together carelessly and have the freedom to decide anything on a moments notice.

Those were the good old golden days.

After few weeks, we longed for our son's milestones - crawling, walking, first words. Watching other kids, we counted the days until our little one could do the same.

Now he runs, talks, throws stuff all over, and stuffs into his mouth whatever he can put his hands on. It's chaos when our son is around. Sometimes, my wife and I long for the quiet infant days when all he did was sleep, eat, and poop.

Those were the good old golden days.

I see a pattern now. We always chase what's next but look back with longing at what has passed. Good old golden days are right here, right now. It's happening while I write and while you read this words.

It's the smallest things that shine brightest. 

When you look back, you don't remember the stress. You remember the smell of the rain, a baby's laugh, family's support, casual evening conversation with your spouse. That's the truth about good old golden days. They're made of small, ordinary things that you're living right now.

Enjoy the gentle summer sun rays kissing your skin instead of whining about the heat. Because when the winter comes, you'll find yourself longing for that warmth. The golden days aren't gone. They're happening now.

Don't let today slip away unnoticed. These are our good old golden days.
