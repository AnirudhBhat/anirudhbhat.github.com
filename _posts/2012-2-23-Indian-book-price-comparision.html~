<h1>Indian book price comparision</h1>
<p>
  I was searching price of the book the other day visiting every Indian e-commerce site comparing prices trying to save some money.I was getting seriously annoyed because every time i had to buy some books i had to go to every Indian e-commerce site and compare price......
And thus i did what every programmer would do.Just hacked up a simple site which gives you price of book from 8 different stores.
All you need to do is enter ISBN of book you want and BOOM!! you get the prices of that book from 8 different stores....
so no more searching each and every site.
The site is just a weekend hack to scratch my own itch,its messy,no caching technique used and also slow as it has to scrape prices from different sites. But hey it does the job...

allright technical stack used for this project is Google app engine(GAE),programmed in python.
The site is live at http://www.indianbookprice.appspot.com/
its also OPEN SOURCE.feel free to hack the code to your hearts desire.
