This image was taken on one fine evening when I was standing outside my house and I had the whole evening to me with nothing to do. Oh, what a great feeling it is to have plenty of free time with you and there is nothing stressfull to occupy your mind and spoil the moment. We all should savor these moments and appreciate the mindfullness it brings.

>Free time was the most precious time, when you should be doing what you loved, or at least slowing down enough to remember what made your life worthwhile and happy.
