# **About me**

# **Android developer**
I am an Android developer with a passion for writing clean and maintainable code and a big believer in writing good unit tests. I love writing code as much as writing tests for them.


# **My professional principles**
- [I don't have a dream company.](https://workchronicles.com/dream-job/)

- Technology is just a means and not an end.

- Boring tech choices.

- Simple code > > > Clever code

- I care more about the product than the technology.

- Code is a liability, not an asset.

- I believe software engineering interviews are broken and is one of the worst.


# **Work**
Mobile wrangling at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/). Previously, [Noon academy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noonEdu.k12App&hl=en_IN)


# **Outside of work**
I have a very beautiful wife with whom i spend **most** of my time

I love reading, travelling and lifting weights.
