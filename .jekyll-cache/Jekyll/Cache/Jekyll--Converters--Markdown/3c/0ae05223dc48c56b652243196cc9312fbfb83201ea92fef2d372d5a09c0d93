I"v<p>Everyone in this world wants to become extraordinary. Everyone wants to make a dent in the world. People see multi-billionaire businessmen and rave about becoming one, people want to become a scientist and change the world with their invention, they want to get into Google, Facebook, to make an impact and look down upon someone who works in a small but healthy company.</p>

<p>The problem with most of them is they enjoy the result of being extraordinary, being multi-billionaire, being a founder. They miss-calculate the sacrifices involved in that. Once you get to know the cost it takes to get there, most of them are better off living an ordinary life. Most importantly, they will be happy.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with being ordinary, enjoying a mediocre life. In fact, living a life like this is what brings happiness and satisfaction to most of them.</p>

<p>We chase our imaginary lifestyle all throughout our lives while we miss the beauty nature offers in our everyday lives. We work 80 hours a week to buy a villa while we forget to enjoy sitting on the balcony, sipping coffee, and observing the leaves swaying by for the gentle cool breeze outside on a cloudy day.</p>

<p>Once you settle for being ordinary, not caring or comparing with others, you start observing that you seem to be more happy, content, and satisfied.</p>

<p>We should naturally try to give the journey more attention, We should look out of the window and try to appreciate the view whenever we can.</p>

<p><strong>Donâ€™t attach your professional life with your identity. You are much more than that</strong></p>

<p><strong>Untill next time</strong></p>
