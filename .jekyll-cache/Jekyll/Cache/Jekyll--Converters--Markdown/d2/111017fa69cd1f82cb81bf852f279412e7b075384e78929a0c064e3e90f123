I"±<p>When classes become quite large (Always try to have a class with less than 200 lines :) ), it becomes hard to focus on certain piece of logic without all the noise/distraction from other code present in the same file. To solve this we can use what is called as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Regions</code> in Android studio.</p>

<h2 id="regions">Regions</h2>
<p>As the name says it basically helps in creating regions in android studio. We can have regions for click listeners, Global variables, UI setup, Lifecycle methods..etc. We can create regions in Android studio like shown below</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>//region UI setup
	setupRecyclerView()
	setupTabs()
	 â€¦etc
//endregion
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is how regions will look when collapsed in Android studio</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Command + shift + plus (+) expands the entire file</p>

<p>Command + shift + minus(-) collapses the entire file</p>

<p>If you want to expand or collapse a certain region then</p>

<p>Command + plus(+) expands region</p>

<p>Command + minus(-) collapses region</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it for now. Hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/abhat38">twitter</a> if you have any cool tips that you want to share.</p>
