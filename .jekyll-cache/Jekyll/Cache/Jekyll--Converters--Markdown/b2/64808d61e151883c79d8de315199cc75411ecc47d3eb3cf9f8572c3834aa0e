I"g<p>Most of us might have faced the problem of losing the scroll position of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RecyclerView</code> when your Activity/Fragment is recreated. This usually happens because the Adapter data is loaded asynchronously and data hasnâ€™t loaded by the time RecyclerView needs to layout so it fails to restore the scroll position.</p>
