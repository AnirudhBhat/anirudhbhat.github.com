I"î<p><strong>Empathy during the code review:</strong> This is a big one for me. Always keep in mind that you are reviewing the code and not the author. Iâ€™ve been on the other side to know how it feels when the reviewer is not empathetic. If you think some piece of logic can be done in a better way. Provide concrete examples and <strong>explain</strong> why you think your example is better than theirs. Also, this should never be forced upon the author and act as a blocker for PR merge.</p>
