I"?<p>Most of them get their daily dose of news online nowadays. IMHO reading news from the internet is more of a distraction and filled with personal opinions rather than the actual news.</p>

<p>I always prefer reading the news in the newspaper. No bullshit, no drama, pure news. Most importantly, there is no rabbit hole to fall into in newspapers, unlike the internet where there are thousands of interconnected links in single news.</p>

<p>Also, online news try to push their biased opinions into ours. The comment section where every individual will push his own opinion on the topic. This can be toxic as well.</p>

<p>It is important to read news and form our own opinion without getting biased by reading other peopleâ€™s opinions.</p>

<p>Any activity which does not involve any screens is always good and healthier :)</p>
